## Project 2 in Machine Programming
*Mandertory project 2 for **02322** Machine oriented programming.*

In this project I made a cardgame in the terminal using double-linked lists in C. The name of the cardgame is ***Yukon***
The goal of the game is the end up with 4 stacks of each card type, going from the lowest to the highest card.
